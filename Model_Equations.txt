*** Control Parameters ***
Simulation Time = 100 Months
Time Step = 0.125 Months
Integration Type = Euler

*** Stocks (State Variables) ***

Target: Allostatic_Load
Description: Accumulated physiological stress from resource deprivation and environmental threats.
Equation: INTEGRAL(Stress_Accumulation - Stress_Recovery, Initial_Load)
Initial_Load = 0.2

Target: Resource_Deprivation
Description: The state of lacking essential survival resources (housing, food, etc.).
Equation: INTEGRAL(Depletion_Rate - Resource_Acquisition, Initial_Deprivation)
Initial_Deprivation = 0.5

Target: Social_Capital
Description: Connection to social support networks and trust levels.
Equation: INTEGRAL(Social_Reconnection - Social_Withdrawal, Initial_Social_Capital)
Initial_Social_Capital = 0.5

*** Flows (Rates of Change) ***

Target: Stress_Accumulation
Equation: (Resource_Deprivation * Stress_Sensitivity) + (Rule_Tightening_Impact * Shelter_Residence_Status)

Target: Stress_Recovery
Equation: (Allostatic_Load / Recovery_Time) * Housing_Stability_Factor

Target: Survival_Crime_Rate
Description: The flow of committing crimes for survival (Theft, Survival Sex, etc.)
Equation: Base_Crime_Rate * Probability_of_Crime

*** Auxiliary Variables & Functions ***

Target: Probability_of_Crime
Description: Logistic function determining crime probability based on brain load.
Equation: (1 / (1 + EXP( -Steepness_k * (Allostatic_Load - Neuro_Threshold) ) )) * (1 - Resilience)
Param: Steepness_k = 5.0
Param: Neuro_Threshold = 0.6
Param: Resilience = 0.2 (Baseline)

Target: Shelter_Residence_Status
Description: 1 if in shelter, 0 if on street.
Equation: IF THEN ELSE( Resources < 0.2, 1, 0)

Target: Iatrogenic_Effect_Switch
Description: Policy switch. 1 = Current System (Conditional), 0 = HF4Y (Unconditional).
Value: 1 

Target: Housing_Stability_Factor
Description: Effect of HF4Y intervention.
Equation: IF THEN ELSE( Iatrogenic_Effect_Switch = 0, 2.0, 0.5 )
